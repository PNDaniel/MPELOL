To calculate a matchup's value:

Each team has a number of followers [Team.popularity].

Let Team A have x followers and Team B have y followers:

Let x = 50 and y = 20;

the maximum number of followers of BOTH teams will be 20.
Hence, we decided to use logarithm function of base 15 to determine the percentage of double followers.
[Base 15, because we shall ignore any similarity smaller than this]

log15(20) = 1.106, which implies that 10% of those 20 followers are from both teams.

Hence we get the total x+y followers and subtract these 10%:

x+y - 10%*20 = 70-2 = 68; 


This will create some fringe cases with intended interactions, where a matchup with
x = 50 and y = 20 will have [slightly] more estimated viewers than a matchup with x = 40 and y = 40.



 Rule 2: 
 
 
 After a given threshold nonetheless [x+y>=80], there will be a boost of viewers associated with it being an important match.
Since it shall be an important match, between two above average popular teams, there will be more publicity and the game may make front page
of streaming websites such as Twitch.
Hence, another logarithmic bonus will be given to any game that crosses that popularity sum threshold.
